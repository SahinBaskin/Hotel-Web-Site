ðŸŒŸ My New Project: Hotel Website ðŸŒŸ

I've just completed a hotel website project! For this project, 
I used only HTML and CSS to create a clean and fully responsive site. ðŸš€

ðŸ”¹ Fully Responsive: The website is designed to be compatible with all devices, 
providing a seamless user experience on mobile phones, tablets, and desktops.

ðŸ”¸ Pages:

Home Page: Provides a general overview of the hotel.
Room Types: Detailed information about different room options and their features.
Contact: Quick access to contact information for the hotel.
Blog: Includes news about the hotel and travel tips.
This project helped me enhance my HTML and CSS skills and apply what Iâ€™ve learned about web design. 
My goal was to create a fully responsive experience.
